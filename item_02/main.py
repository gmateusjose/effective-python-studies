"""
02. Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide

Things to remember:

- Always follow the Python Enhancement Proposal #8 (PEP 8) style
guide when writing Python code.

- Sharing a common style with the larger Python community
facilitates collaboration with others.

- Using a consistent sytle makes it easier to modify your own
code later.
